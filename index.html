          <p>
            I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at MIT's Security Studies Program (SSP). 
            My current research aims to assess the potential for emerging technologies to increase the vulnerability of US ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) to preemptive attacks by near-peer rivals.

            I received my PhD from the Nuclear Science and Engineering Department at MIT. 
            My doctoral research assessed whether the emergence of hypersonic weapons could increase the likelihood of nuclear war between the US, Russia, and China.
            It analyzed two issues: (1) Whether conventionally-armed hypersonic weapons could be used to conduct counterforce 
            strikes (i.e. strikes against an adversary's nuclear weapons), and (2) whether hypersonic weapons' 
            capacity for midcourse maneuvering could introduce risks of conventional wars inadvertently escalating to 
            nuclear war (an issue often referred to as "destination ambiguity").
